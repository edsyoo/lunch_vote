# lunch_vote
Lunch Vote Test project

This is just a fun attempt to play with Ruby and create a lunch vote script.

Quick start up if ruby is installed (and gem):

`sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev`
`gem install bundler data_mapper dm-mysql-adapter`
`bundle install`
`ruby lunch_vote.rb`

After that, a site should be available at http://localhost:4567
